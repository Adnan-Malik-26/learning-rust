# Rust Learning Repository 🚀

This repository contains all the code and exercises I am using to learn Rust. It includes various projects, exercises, and experiments as I explore the language.

## 📖 Resources

Here are some of the resources I am using to learn Rust:

- 📘 [Brown University's Rust Book](https://rust-book.cs.brown.edu/ch03-00-common-programming-concepts.html) - A well-structured guide covering Rust's core concepts.
- 📖 [The Rust Programming Language (Official Book)](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) - The best starting point for learning Rust from scratch.
- 🔍 [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/) - A hands-on guide with real examples.
- 📜 [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) - Small exercises to get comfortable with Rust syntax.

## 🚀 How to Run Code

1. Install Rust using [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)
2. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rust-learning.git
   ```
3. Navigate to a project directory and run:
   ```sh
   cargo run
   ```

## 🔥 Goals

- Understand Rust's ownership and borrowing system.
- Get comfortable with pattern matching and error handling.
- Explore concurrency and async programming.
- Build small projects to reinforce learning.

Happy coding! 🦀🚀
